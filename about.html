								<h3> <br> </b>How we got started: <br /> <i> prepare yourself for the lies </i> </h3>
							</header>
							<p> We started this website because of our interest in biology and medical systems, as most of us come from
								a scientific background. We were brought together by coding and wante dto create a sitde for merging these interests which
								viewers could refer to to keep up with the latest changes in our field. In MIT’s technology review for the 50 smartest companies in the world which
								combine innovative technology and an effective business model 10 of these companies were directly related to biomedicine.
								We believe the future of technology is approaching singularity and it is start ups which make genetics accessible to the public and
								fast track medical procedures are the future. <br />
							Our core belief? <br> <b> Advancing biotechnology is advancing humanity </b> <br />
							This is because we approach an entirely indutrialised age, the only thing we have left to advance, is ourselves. 	</p>

								<h3> <br> </b> Project of the month<br /> <i> Zipline: drones that save lives </i> </h3>
							</header>
							<p> One of start-ups that we are really interested in is called Zipline, it is the world’s only drone delivery system at
							national scale, such that it is able to to send urgent medicines to patients, regardless of their location. We think
							it puts an already created technology (drones) to a more altruistic purpose without having to build on the concept too much.
							Using drones bypasses so many of the issues that travel brings, and is much more time-sensitive option. Other than the innovation
							behind the project, We are impressed by the way the technology was altered to make ordering supplies accessible to  the general public--
							the start up allows for orders via text message and packs the orders within minutes in a centralised distribution centre.  </p>
